# KBase SDK version of HipMer
---

This is module wraps the HipMer assembler so that it can be executed in KBase.  This is specifically designed to run on HPC-class resources and
is currently designed to specifically for systems at NERSC (www.nersc.gov).  This module utilizes an HPC-mode for KBase that is still
under development.

For details on HipMer see https://sourceforge.net/projects/hipmer/.

NOTE: Unlike other KBase SDK Apps, The actual hipmer binary is not currently captured in the SDK module.  This will be addressed in the future.
