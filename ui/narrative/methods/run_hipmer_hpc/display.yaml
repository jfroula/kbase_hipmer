# Configure the display and description of parameters
#
parameters :
    read_library_name :
        ui-name : Read Library
        short-hint : Read library (only PairedEnd Libs supported now)
    output_contigset_name:
        ui-name : Output ContigSet name
        short-hint : Enter a name for the assembled contigs data object
    mer_size:
        ui-name : k-mer size
        short-hint : k-mer size to use in the assembly process
    is_diploid:
        ui-name : Is the genome diploid (true/false)
        short-hint : |
            Is this a diploid genome?  If so, HipMer will attempt to
            identify and merge haplotype variants (bubbles in the k-mer graph)
            See also 'bubble_min_depth_cutoff'

    min_depth_cutoff:
        ui-name : Min Depth Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            K-mers present at frequencies less than this cutoff get culled from the assembly
            early on.  To auto-detect, set to 0

    dynamic_min_depth:
        ui-name : Dynamic Min Depth
        short-hint : TBD

    gap_close_rpt_depth_ratio:
        ui-name : Gap Close Repeat Depth Ratio
        short-hint : |
            Scaffolds with depth of coverage this many times higher than the
            average across all scaffolds are considered repeats
            and won't participate in gap closure (default 2.0)

    assm_scaff_len_cutoff:
        ui-name : Assembly Scaffold Lenth cutoff
        short-hint : TBD

    bubble_min_depth_cutoff:
        ui-name : Bubble Min Depth Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            For diploid organisms, this is the depth cutoff to exclude
            unresolved haplotypes. To auto-detect, set to 0.  To keep both
            haplotypes in cases where they couldn't be merged, set it to 1
            (Note, this will hinder gap closing and scaffolding)

    prefix:
        ui-name : prefix
        short-hint : Name of the library

    #ins_avg:
    #    ui-name : Insert Average (int)
    #    short-hint :  Estimated average Insert Length for Parid-End Reads in bp

    #ins_dev:
    #    ui-name : Insert Deviation (int)
    #    short-hint :  Estimated std. Deviation of insert size in bp

    #avg_read_len:
    #    ui-name : Average Read Len (int)
    #    short-hint :  Estimated average read Length

    has_innie_artifact:
        ui-name : Has Innie Artifact (T/F)
        short-hint : |
            Whether or not a significant fraction of read pairs is in
            nondominant orientation, e.g. "innies" in an "outie" library or
            vice versa. (T/F)

    #is_rev_comped:
    #    ui-name : Is Reversed Comped (T/F)
    #    short-hint : |
    #        Whether or not the read pairs are in the "outie" orientation,
    #        i.e <-- -->. (T/F)

    use_for_contigging:
        ui-name : Use for Contigging (T/F)
        short-hint :  |
            Whether or not to use this libray for initial contig generation.
            The recommendation is to use only paired-end libraries for this
            purpose. (T/F)

    ono_set_id:
        ui-name : Scaffoling round (pos. int)
        short-hint : |
            Assigns the library to a scaffolding round. Libraries of the same
            type and similar insert size should be grouped into the same round
            for the sake of performance. To completely exclude a library from
            being used in scaffolding, set this to 0. (positive integers,
            can be non-consecutive)

    use_for_gap_closing:
        ui-name : Use for Gap Closing (T/F)
        short-hint : |
            Whether or not to use this library for gap closing. It's best to
            use the same libraries that were used for contig generation for
            this purpose. (T/F)

    fp_wiggle_room:
        ui-name : 5' Wiggle Room (int)
        short-hint : |
            During linkage analysis and gap closure, allow reads from this
            library to have an unaligned 5' end up to this many bp. This
            option is for cases when a library is known to contain untrimmed
            adapter sequence. (positive integer, 0 for default behavior)

    tp_wiggle_room:
        ui-name : 3' Wiggle Room (int)
        short-hint : |
            During linkage analysis and gap closure, allow reads from this
            library to have an unaligned 3' end up to this many bp. This
            option can be used when the library is of poor sequence quality
            at the 3' end. Beware that allowing reads to map with large
            unaligned segments can potentially lead to erroneus linkage and
            other problems in the assembly. Use at your own risk! (positive
            integer, 0 for default behavior)


    use_for_splinting:
        ui-name : Use for Splinting (T/F)
        short-hint : |
            Whether or not to use reads from this library to "splint" small
            gaps during scaffolding.  Splints are single reads aligning across
            two contigs, which can be used to determine the gap size more
            precisely and to confirm/reject a less precise but wider reaching
            pairwise linkage (aka "spans"). We recommend using only fragment
            libraries for splinting.

    <p>KBase wrapper for the HipMer Assembler (v0.9.5).</p>
    <p>HipMer is a high performance parallelization and port of Meraculous ( http://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/meraculous/ ).
       It is largely written in UPC, with the exception of the UFX generation, which is written in C++/MPI.</p>
    <p>For more details see: https://sourceforge.net/p/hipmer/wiki/Home/</p>
    <p>This project is a joint collaboration between UC Berkeley ( http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu ),
    JGI ( http://jgi.doe.gov ), and CRD ( http://crd.lbl.gov/ )</p>

    <p>Primary authors are: Evangelos Georganas, Aydin Buluc, Steven Hofmeyr, Leonid Oliker and
    Rob Egan, with direction and advice from Kathy Yelick. The original Meraculous was developed by
    Jarrod Chapman, Isaac Ho, Eugene Goltsman, and Daniel Rokhsar.</p>
    <p><b>Known limitations</b>: HipMer is still under active development.
    The wrapping of HipMer in KBase does not currently support multiple read libraries and many of the options are hard-coded.</p>
