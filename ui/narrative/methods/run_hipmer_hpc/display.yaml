    <p>KBase wrapper for the HipMer Assembler.</p>
    <p>HipMer is a high performance parallelization and port of Meraculous ( http://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/meraculous/ ).
       It is largely written in UPC, with the exception of the UFX generation, which is written in C++/MPI.</p>
    <p>For more details see: https://sourceforge.net/p/hipmer/wiki/Home/</p>
    <p>This project is a joint collaboration between UC Berkeley ( http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu ),
    JGI ( http://jgi.doe.gov ), and CRD ( http://crd.lbl.gov/ )</p>

    <p>Primary authors are: Evangelos Georganas, Aydin Buluc, Steven Hofmeyr, Leonid Oliker and
    Rob Egan, with direction and advice from Kathy Yelick. The original Meraculous was developed by
    Jarrod Chapman, Isaac Ho, Eugene Goltsman, and Daniel Rokhsar.</p>
    <p><b>Known limitations</b>: HipMer is still under active development.
    The wrapping of HipMer in KBase does not currently support multiple read libraries and many of the options are hard-coded.</p>
