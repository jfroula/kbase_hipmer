A multi-argument parameter defining various properties of the input datasets.
Normally, for every sequencing library, a separate lib_seq parameter line should
be given. The following are the mandatory arguments that must be given as
values-only on a single line, in the exact order they’re listed here, separated by
one or more spaces or tabs. None can be omitted.

[ wildcard ] - a bash-style expression (typically a full path) defining the
sequence files for a single library. If fwd and rev read pairs are in
separate files, then two wildcards should be provided, separated by a comma,
without spaces. (See section 'Input data preparation' for more on input data
requirements.)

[ name ] - name of the library
(caps, numbers)

[ insertAvg ] - estimated average insert size in bp

[ insertSdev ] - estimated std deviation of insert size in bp

[ avgReadLn ] - estimated average read length in bp

[ hasInnieArtifact] - Whether or not a significant fraction of read pairs is in nondominant
orientation, e.g. "innies" in an "outie" library or vice versa.
(0=false, 1=true)

[ isRevComped ] - Whether or not the read pairs are in the "outie" orientation,
i.e <-- -->.
(0=false, 1=true)

[ useForContiging ]- Whether or not to use this libray for initial contig
generation. Our recommendation is to use only paired-end libraries for this
purpose.
(0=false, 1=true)

[ scaffRound ] - Assigns the library to a scaffolding round. Libraries of the
same type and similar insert size should be grouped into the same round for the
sake of performance. To completely exclude a library from being used in
scaffolding, set this to 0.
(positive integers, can be non-consecutive)

[ useForGapClosing] - Whether or not to use this library for gap closing. It’s best
to use the same libraries that were used for contig generation for this purpose.
(0=false, 1=true)

[ 5p_wiggleRoom ] - During linkage analysis and gap closure, allow reads from
this library to have an unaligned 5' end up to this many bp. This option is for
cases when a library is known to contain untrimmed adapter sequence.
(positive integer, 0 for default behavior)

[ 3p_wiggleRoom ] - During linkage analysis and gap closure, allow reads from
this library to have an unaligned 3' end up to this many bp. This option can be
used when the library is of poor sequence quality at the 3' end. Beware that
allowing reads to map with large unaligned segments can potentially lead to
erroneus linkage and other problems in the assembly. Use at your own risk!
(positive integer, 0 for default behavior)
Example 1: two sets of files - one with fwd reads and the other with reverse
reads
lib_seq /path/fastq*.0,/path/fastq*.1 ECO1 200 20 36 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
Example 2: one set of files, all with fwd/rev reads interleaved and up to 20 bp
of 5' adapter present
lib_seq /path/to/fastq ECO2 200 20 100 0 0 0 1 0 20 0
genome_size Approximate genome size in Gb. Used in estimating depth of read coverage.
(positive integer or float)
mer_size The k-mer size to use in meraculous. Must be an odd integer less than the size
of the smallest read in the dataset. The optimal k-mer size depends on the
quality of the sequence data and on the genome's repeat content. Picking a kmer
size that's too small means a given sequence will have a lower likelihood of
being unique. Too large, and you're increasing the likelihood that the sequence
will contain an error, which will cause it to be thrown out entirely by the lowdepth
filter. To have Meraculous auto-select one based on genome_size, set
this parameter to 0
There are a number of 3rd party tools available that help you pick the best k-mer
size (e.g. kmergenie), but the following are ballpark guidelines for genomes of
